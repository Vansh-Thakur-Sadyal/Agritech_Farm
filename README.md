## 🎯 Overview

The Agentic AI Farm Intelligence System is a smart agricultural platform that combines modern web interfaces, FastAPI services, and specialized AI agents to assist farmers and agricultural teams with real-time farm monitoring, crop recommendations, disease awareness, and automated planning.

This project is designed to turn raw field telemetry and agricultural data into practical, actionable decisions.

### What this system does
- Collects and standardizes farm-related data such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and crop context.
- Uses AI-driven analysis for crop recommendations and disease-focused insights.
- Orchestrates multiple specialized agents to create a complete farm decision pipeline.
- Exposes a backend API for dashboard integration and automation.
- Offers an interactive frontend experience for visualizing telemetry and running the pipeline.

## 🧠 Core Architecture

The system follows a modular flow:

1. Frontend dashboard collects user inputs and sends them to the backend.
2. FastAPI receives requests and routes them to the orchestrator.
3. The orchestrator runs the workflow across specialized agents.
4. Results are returned to the UI and can be used for monitoring or planning.

Features include:
- Crop and field analysis
- Disease-aware recommendations
- Rule-based and ML-assisted evaluation
- Risk scoring and monitoring insights

### Agent 3: Decision Planning
Transforms analysis results into practical strategies such as irrigation suggestions, resource planning, and recommendation actions.

Features include:
- Strategy generation
- Planning support for yield and sustainability goals
- Integration with monitoring and memory workflows

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Windows quick start
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Vansh-Thakur-Sadyal/Agritech_Farm.git
cd Agritech_Farm
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vansh-Thakur-Sadyal/Agritech_Farm.git
cd Agritech_Farm
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure environment variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root with values such as:

```env
MISTRAL_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

### 5. Start the backend
```bash
cd backend
python -m uvicorn api.server:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001
```

### 6. Start the frontend
From the project root, open the frontend in a simple static server:

```bash
cd frontend
python -m http.server 3000
```

Then visit:
- http://localhost:3000/index.html
- http://localhost:8001/docs for FastAPI docs

## � Demo Preview

A simple dashboard experience is included for interacting with the system and observing the coordinated farm intelligence workflow.

![Agritech Farm Dashboard Preview](assets/hero-banner.svg)

You can expect to see:
- a control panel for farm inputs and field conditions
- agent-driven analysis results
- a chatbot-style interaction panel
- monitoring and planning feedback from the backend pipeline

---

## �🔌 API Endpoints

The backend exposes the following main endpoints:

- POST `/run-agent` — runs the full farm intelligence pipeline
- POST `/chat` — sends a natural-language agricultural query
- GET `/progress` — retrieves current pipeline progress information
- POST `/apply-strategy` — saves a recommended strategy into memory

Example request:
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8001/run-agent \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"Analyze field conditions","agent1":{},"agent2":{},"agent3":{}}'
```

---

## 📦 Running the Dashboard

The frontend is a lightweight dashboard for interacting with the system. It lets you:
- adjust farm parameters
- trigger analysis runs
- visualize system health
- interact with the chatbot interface

The dashboard is expected to communicate with the backend at `http://127.0.0.1:8001`.
